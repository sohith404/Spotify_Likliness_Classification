# Do You Like This Song? 


This Machine Learning (ML) project is part of DAC's project series. It features ML models used to predict if a user will like a song or not based on one of his or her Spotify playlist. Our models were trained using data obtained from our very own Spotify collaborative playlists. One playlist consists of songs we like while the other consists of songs we dislike.

## Motivation

Our group realised that out of all our individual interests, listening to music is something we all enjoy. This inspired us to work on this ML project together.

## Quick Summary

Worked on our dataset using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and XGBoost algorithms, examining the precision of these algorithms in predicting whether a song will be liked or disliked by a user. 

## **Predicting Songs:** 

**Data** 

The datasets are collections of song data from Spotipy, a Python library for the Spotify web API. It consists of 100 songs each from two of our Spotify collaborative playlists. We are able to access artist names, album names, track name, track ID and audio features such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration of songs in milliseconds and time signature.
